 Hello, everyone, my topic is the key factor impacts the house price in Kansas City.

Here is the source data I used in this research.

And here is the figure can get the conclusion. The housing area is the key factor impacts the house price in KC. The housing prices are positively correlated with the house living area.

In this figure, the top right small figure shows the geographic distribution of houses. The main figure are scatter of housing price and area. The size of the point is the relative area of each house.

You may noticed this red line. This red line help me support my viewpoint. It is a linear regression prediction for the price with different house area. I used maximum likelihood estimation to build this model. It is for clearly show the postive correlation between house area and price.

You may wonder how I find this key factor, there are so many factors and they all may have correlation with price intuitively. Firstly, I made some intuitive assumptions and list all potential factors. Secondly, I draw many scatter figures and correlation figures to validate my assumptions.

And I found the key factor, house living area.

Then I use linear regression model to test my viewpoint.

Finally I completed my conclusion with these figures and data.



You may wonder why this is important, why we need to know the key factor impacts the price in KC.

If you are a client and you want to buy a property in KC whatever for living or investing. It's very important to know the main factor impacts the price. Because expect this factor, you can set other factor as optimal, like bedrooms, with yard, waterfront, because you already know these factors won't increase the price notably.
